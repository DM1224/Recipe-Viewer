### Steps to Run the App
Load into Xcode, then Start the Active Scheme

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized the backend implementation, specifically fetching and persisting data using Swift Data. My goal was to ensure the app's core functionality was robust and efficient, as I believe a solid backend is the foundation for a successful app. While UI design is important, I intentionally chose to focus on backend development first because it’s critical for ensuring a smooth and scalable user experience. This approach allowed me to allocate my time effectively while embracing the challenge of learning and applying Swift Data for persistent storage.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent approximately 7 hours on this project. The majority of that time was dedicated to understanding and implementing Swift Data, as it was new to me. I reviewed Apple’s documentation and explored various examples to ensure I applied it effectively. The remaining time was spent integrating the API, handling edge cases, and implementing a basic UI to meet the project requirements.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Yes, I consciously traded off UI refinement in favor of backend functionality and learning Swift Data. While my typical workflow involves creating a wireframe and a clear UX flow upfront, I reversed this approach for this project, starting with API calls and data handling. This decision was influenced by the simplicity of the app’s requirements and my confidence in SwiftUI. I knew I could deliver a functional and visually acceptable UI quickly, allowing me to focus on mastering the backend, which was more critical given the project’s scope.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The Swift Data models and their current implementation are areas I know can be improved. Given more time, I would have focused on refining these models, reducing complexity, and measuring performance to ensure optimal behavior. There are minor runtime errors related to Swift Data, but none of them cause crashes or hinder functionality. With additional iteration, I could address these issues and elevate the app’s stability and performance.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This project was my first hands-on experience with Swift Data, and I underestimated its complexity. I typically use the Observable Object pattern for data handling, but I saw this as an opportunity to learn and implement a new paradigm. While this added to the overall time spent, it was a rewarding experience. If I had been more familiar with Swift Data, I could have completed the project in 4 hours. Regardless, this assignment was an excellent learning experience, and I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to future projects. I genuinely enjoyed the process and appreciated the opportunity to solve real-world challenges in this format.
